title: 'Math, CS, and Epidemiology Notes'
---

I've been in grad school for *checks watch* approximately two weeks, and I've quickly realized that I need a system of accountability when it comes to my own self-learning, of which I'll have to do a lot throughout the course of my program. For me, I've found that formalizing my learning through rigorous notes and problem solutions is one good way to work towards that accountability. It has the unintended benefit of aggregating material that may be useful in the future. To that end, I'll be uploading various Overleaf documents with my explorations on topics in math, CS, epidemiology (and probably others). This is mostly for me, but I hope these musings might be useful to someone else too.
